# CovDB Addon

Project inspired by [PvPDB.io](https://github.com/qwazerty/pvpdb.io)

WoW (Retail) addon used to show player covenant information in tooltips and LFG.

## Usage
Place the extracted directories into your `C:\Program Files (x86)\World of Warcraft\_retail_\Interface\AddOns\` folder.

You can disable factions/regions not used. Each DB does a region match against the player before loading.
