# CovDB Addon

Project inspired by [PvPDB.io](https://github.com/qwazerty/pvpdb.io)

Show selected covenant in mouseover (friendly and enemy players) and LFG tooltips.

Since Covenants can only change once a week per player, the DB for the addon is expected to be updated twice a week.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Reduce memory footprint/lazy load
- [ ] Add support for chat commands to output raid/party covenant details in chat.
- [ ] Add support for all regions.
    - This should come before the next weekly update.
